    "The system prompt and the user prompt are not passed in as separate parameters to the core model. Instead, they are combined into a single, continuous sequence of tokens that forms the complete context for the Large Language Model (LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is known as prompt serialization and involves two key mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Special Tokens for Role Separation\n",
    "The key to distinguishing the different roles is the use of special control tokens that were included in the model's training data. These tokens act as invisible tags, telling the model the nature of the text that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "System Prompt: The system prompt text is typically placed at the very beginning of the token sequence and is wrapped in special tokens that designate it as high-level instructions (e.g., <|system|> or <|begin_of_text|>).\n",
    "\n",
    "User Prompt: The user's query is placed after the system prompt (and any previous conversation history) and is wrapped in its own special tokens (e.g., <|user|> or <|end_of_system|>).\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Structure: The entire input stream looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<|system|> You are a helpful assistant. <|end_system|>\n",
    "<|user|> What are the steps to bake a cake? <|end_user|>\n",
    "<|assistant|>\n",
    "The model then predicts the next token, which is the start of the assistant's response. The training process has taught the model to pay special attention to the tokens enclosed in the system tags and follow those instructions for the entire duration of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Concatenation and Positional Encoding\n",
    "Tokenization: Both the system prompt and the user prompt (along with any past conversation history) are first converted into a sequence of numerical tokens by the tokenizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenation: The token sequences for the system and user roles are simply joined together in a specific order (System → Conversation History → New User Prompt) to form one long input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional Encoding: Before being fed into the Transformer, a positional encoding is added to each token. This encoding tells the model the exact position of that token in the overall sequence. This is how the model knows that the text from the system prompt came first and should be treated as the persistent context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the LLM views the entire input as one long transcript or document, and the special tokens and their position are what allow it to logically separate the general behavioral rules (system) from the immediate task (user).\n",
    "\n",
    "The video How LLMs Work & Why Prompt Engineering Matters can help illustrate the underlying mechanism of how language models process and generate responses from an input token stream."
