This is a repo to be used for students on the SuperDataScience (SDS) AI Bootcamp.

We are working to prepare the materials for Week 2 if the bootcamp, in the week2 folder.

The full path to the project root is:
/Users/ed/projects/sds/

The week2 folder is:
/Users/ed/projects/sds/week2

The week is all about RAG.

In this folder is synthetic data about a fictional company, Insurellm.

Please read all the files in knowledge-base/company/ to learn about the company.

Also review the list of files in the other knowledge-base subdirectories.

ACTION PLAN:

1. Create a new python notebook called lab2.ipynb in week2
2. In the first cell, use glob.glob to read in the contents of the entire knowledgebase into 1 big string "entire_knowledge_base"
3. In the next cell, use tiktoken (which is included in our uv environment) to count the tokens for gpt-4.1-mini model
