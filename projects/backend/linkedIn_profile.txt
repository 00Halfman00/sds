AI 2025
Gemini 2.5 Flash

What are the biggest AI conferences happening in the world for the rest of 2025?

Gemini:
Here is a list with about a dozen conferences around the world.

Me:
Use the sources of news articles on the field of AI that you used. Please summarize the articles and write a compelling social media post for LinkedIn highlighting key points about each article.
The post should be short and concise and should not be more than 100 words.

Gemini:
The AI landscape is shifting fast! ðŸš€

Google's Gemini 2.5 achieved a historic breakthrough, winning gold at a programming contest and demonstrating a "profound leap in abstract problem-solving."

Meta is blurring the lines between physical and digital with new AI-powered smart glasses controlled by a neural wristband.

Meanwhile, an AI tool named Delphi-2M is revolutionizing healthcare, predicting a personâ€™s risk for over 1,000 diseases.

Itâ€™s clear AI is no longer just for softwareâ€”it's transforming business, health, and how we interact with the world. hashtag#AI hashtag#Technology hashtag#Innovation hashtag#SuperDataScience
